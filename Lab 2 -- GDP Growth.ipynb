    "> In this lab, I will be using WorldBank's 2017 GDP data to determine a few things. I want to find the average GDP of every country, as well as the minimum and maximum GDP's. I'm specifically curious to see whether the U.S. has the highest GDP of any country. I also want to see whether or not the lowest GDP is shockingly low or not. Finally, I'm curious whether or not the average GDP is comparable to other country's GDP's (such as the mininum and maximum GDP)."

I used the keyword \"with\" to specify to Python that I wanted the file closed after the code block had been executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Storing the Data for Analysis***\n",
    "> Since the data has over 200 rows and over 30 columns, it did not make sense to store the rows or colums as hand-crafted lists. Instead, I created a matrix of lists (essentially a 2D array), by iterating through each row, then splitting the row by colums and storing the individual elements. I neglected the final element in each row (as indicated by the \"[:-1]\"), because it was an empty string."

The only aspect that would cause problems during analyses was the fact that some of the countries were not actually that; they were groups of countries. To deal with that, I simply deleted their row from the matrix, so that it was exclusively countries. Otherwise, the maximum GDP would have been astronomically high. The individual groups of countries are commented in the code.\n",
    "\n",
